# Data-and-Analysis-for-PLCD-Mixtures
Data and Analysis code used in the following paper "Phase Separation of Protein Mixtures is Driven by the Interplay of Homotypic and Heterotypic Interactions"


The PLCD_Sequences directory contains the sequences found in the bioinformatics analysis using the DrLLPS database and the PLAAC analyzer. The files that end in "PLCD.fasta" list the PLCDs of the sequences associated with the given condensate. Those that end in "PLCD_Full_Seq.fasta" list the full sequences.

The file Traj_Analyzer_Runner takes the required arguments and calls traj_analyzer_multi_new to perform the analyses described in the paper.

The file Experimental_Data.xlsx contains all experimental data presented in the paper.
